# Sensitivity tests

These scripts run the sensitivity test runs.
Move de desired script to the ./src folder and run with the proper python interpreter
These programs are meant to run in an HPC server. 
If you want to run in your PC I recommend that you do it for a small number of grid points (While creating the initial conditions file)
