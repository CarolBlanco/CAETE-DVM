# CAETÊ
(SOFTWARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
This is the implementation of the Dynamic version of CAETÊ - including Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycling

The code in this repository is based on a earlier version of CAETÊ that was not dynamic and did not have the N and P cycling implemented.

THis is part of my ongoing PhD research project.
